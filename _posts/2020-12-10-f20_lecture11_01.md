#### Introduction
Located on the Colorado River, the Hoover Dam was constructed in the interest of irrigation, hydroelectric power, and flood control. Pushed through by California Senator Hiram Johnson and Head of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) William Mulholland, this monumental construction project was approved by Congress in 1928. Hoover Dam later became part of the New Deal’s dam construction program to help the economy after the Great Depression. Construction began on July 7, 1930 and finished in 1936, resulting in the inauguration parade as captured in the picture. Despite the flashy inauguration parade, the work environment of the dam was severely dangerous, with loose safety guidelines and official fatality tolls not reflecting the reality of the project. While 96 people were killed in the official count, the number did not include those who died of heat stroke, exhaust fumes, and later of complications. Nonetheless, the Hoover Dam’s contribution to water and power promoted local growth in agriculture and economy in the postwar period.

#### History of the Hoover Dam and Los Angeles
Ezra Scattergood was a central figure to the development of Los Angeles’ municipal electric system. As the chief engineer of the Bureau of Los Angeles Aqueduct Power and the Bureau of Power and Light, Scattergood understood the need to meet Los Angeles’ rising electrical demand. Since hydroelectric power was one of the most economical electricity sources at that time, he advocated for the bill that approved the Boulder Canyon Project, now known as the Hoover Dam. Though the proposal had its opponents, the bill successfully passed through Congress in 1928. The dam started construction in 1930. To fully exploit the dam’s hydroelectric powers, Scattergood built the 266-mile Boulder Transmission line with a $23 million loan acquired from the government. When completed in 1936, the line was the longest and highest voltage power transmission system in the world (Past- DWP).

#### Photo Description 
Taken on October 9, 1936, the photograph shows the power inaugural of the Hoover Dam. Elizabeth Scattergood, daughter of “the father of Municipal power in Los Angeles” Ezra Scattergood, flipped the switch that allowed light to flood into LA. This event sparked a parade of almost 1,000,000 people who gathered in the downtown Los Angeles district from end to end. Thomas Treanor, a Los Angeles Times writer, claimed that the parade yielded “an exuberance and spontaneous feeling that has not been observed since the demonstration the day the World War ended” (LA Times). The celebration marked a great progression for the city of Los Angeles. 

#### Impacts of the Hoover Dam Today
The construction of the Hoover Dam was crucial to the growth of Los Angeles. Its abundant and inexpensive power supply facilitated a period of mass population growth and industrial development, allowing Los Angeles to emerge as the second-largest city in the United States. The Hoover Dam also serves as a symbol of the vitality of the Great American Desert, as its overwhelming success proved that the aridity of the land was “no serious obstacle to its full settlement and development” (“Hoover Dam Begins Transmitting Electricity to Los Angeles”). 

Over time, long-term drought as an effect of climate change has significantly decreased the water supply of the Colorado River. Lake Mead is currently 37 percent full -- a historic low for a reservoir that supplies drinking water and energy to a large portion of the western United States. Consequently, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, an operator of the dam, is now seeking to pursue a 3 billion dollar project that would construct a “20-mile underground pumped hydropower storage system” in order to mitigate water loss, as well as cut fossil fuel use (Arrigo). The department proposed the use of solar and wind energy to power the dam. Since renewable energy is dependent on natural forces, inconsistencies of sunshine and wind can decrease the amount of energy supplied by the Hoover Dam. On the other hand, an overabundance of sunshine and wind power can cause the electrical grid to malfunction. This storage system would regulate the amount of water that runs through the dam’s generators by sending excess supply back up to Lake Mead to be released later in order to offset overloading the electrical grid (Penn). The hydropower storage system could be the first step towards a carbon neutral future, which in turn would combat the issue of water loss in the Colorado River. 

#### Conclusion
Today, the Hoover Dam remains as an important electricity supplier, fueling Los Angeles with the necessary energy to sustain itself as the largest city in the West. The Hoover Dam has promoted economic growth and technological advancement since its construction; however, the dam is now facing scrutiny for habitat destruction and significantly decreased water supply in the local region. While further renovations will continue to increase the sustainability of the infrastructure, the Hoover Dam stands as a hallmark of Los Angeles’s dominance and ambition amidst its rapid growth. The vibrant inauguration parade precisely captures this enthusiasm towards future progress, when Los Angeles acquired the world’s largest hydroelectric installation at the time.
