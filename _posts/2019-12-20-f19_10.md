   From grapevines and meadows to industrialized buildings, the city of Los Angeles has developed dramatically since its founding in 1781. Places such as Staples Center, the Griffith Observatory, and the United States Bank Building are among some of the iconic establishments located in Los Angeles that also play a role in the city’s wealth. However, a building that often gets overlooked despite its significance to the Los Angeles economy is the World Trade Center. 

Located in the heart of Los Angeles, the World Trade Center’s purpose is to support the development of international trade and business opportunities for Southern California companies. As the leading international trade association in the Los Angeles region, the World Trade Center is a destination for foreign investment to flow to the city. It has contributed over $1 billion in foreign investment for Los Angeles county. This center continues to provide for the city's economy through international support, making Los Angeles a great industrialized city. 

Los Angeles proposed a modern plan to create the World Trade Center in order to remove any constraints affecting the expansion of international business trade and foreign investments. The Trade Center, completed in 1973, is part of a greater affiliation known as Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC), a nonprofit organized to harness the power of the private sector in collaboration with the county of LA to improve the economic well-being of the city and the nation. This L-shaped office building promotes business with other countries such as Mexico, Europe, Canada, the Middle East, and especially the Pacific Rim, key foreign countries instrumental to Los Angeles’ economy. In order to meet its goal of facilitating business opportunities, the World Trade Center Los Angeles (WTCLA) provides two major business services. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Attraction Services assist international companies to expand their business in LA, and the Export Facilitation Services assist local companies to export to international markets. 

There were numerous economic proposals for the WTCLA, but only one suitable offer supported the goal of improving the economy. For instance, the Real Estate Research Corporation finished the study of the economic feasibility for the World Trade Center regarding alternative planning concepts. They found site locations that serve the international financial and commercial interests of Los Angeles. Additionally, they evaluated the relative merits and weaknesses that they believed could affect the economic viability of the World Trade Center to be built on Parcel F of the Bunker Hill project adjoining the Los Angeles Convention Center. The Research Corporation concluded that Parcel F would be the most appropriate place  because the Bunker Hill project was a sensible size to fit the indicated market. In addition to this, The Bunker Hill proposal could accommodate any excess of demands in nearby office projects compared to the Charles Luckman Associates (CLA) proposal. Moreover, by 1972, the Bunker Hill project was financially stable so that the trade center could be finished by 1973. Although the site of Bunker Hill would demand an increase of 60 percent or more than the average rental rate of $9.00, it was a better option compared to the CLA concept that would have more than doubled average rental rates resulting in a rental rate of $11.50. The CLA had an expensive proposal evidenced by the numerous additional costs such as on-site parking and a mall that would add between $15 million and $20 million to the original estimates. With these statistics in mind, the Bunker Hill Project would be the most economically feasible proposal towards the World Trade Center. 

The WTCLA was built in hopes of creating a stimulation of the city’s economy that would last for years to come. Decades later, we can see for ourselves that the WTCLA fulfilled its original promise. In 2015, twenty-seven years after it opened its doors to the public and the world, it created an estimated 177,427 jobs from the 4,367 foreign-owned establishments in Los Angeles. This high number of jobs wielded in an impressive $11.9 billion. By the end of the year, the Los Angeles county’s gross domestic product (GDP) was $664 billion. These statistics can be rightfully credited to the World Trade Center’s attempts in supporting international partnerships within Southern California. Due to their effort in persuading foreign businesses to invest in the area, the area’s value increased which created jobs, wages, and wealth. As of now, Los Angeles is the leading county economy in the country and a model for two-way trade in the United States (The World Trade Center Association). 

The World Trade Center is located at 444 Flower St, Los Angeles, CA 90071. Its external beauty pleases the eyes, while its internal function pleases the city. The building, surrounded by trees and flowers, exudes elegance with its modernistic look. With a gross square foot of 370,209, the trade center consists of a lobby building that leads to the main ten-story glass and steel tower. Within the lower concourse of the trade center, there are roomy courtyards with seating areas open to the public, along with shops and financial institutions. As people ascend the building, passing the grand marble corridors, they find themselves in class A office buildings. These spaces are highly coveted due to their views of the financial district and comfortable workspace. To top it off, people can access the roof, allowing workers to gaze over the city they help maintain. 

The city of Los Angeles has many important buildings, all uniting to create a functioning and successful metropolis. The World Trade Center is among these buildings, bolstering the economy through its presence in the world market. The WTCLA has successfully guided the Los Angeles region into a promising economy through international trade and investments, which will continue to benefit the city’s wealth and future.
