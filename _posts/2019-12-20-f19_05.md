   In the winter of 1984, Los Angeles underwent a magnificent transformation. Records show that between the months of January and August, the number of trees existing in the dry city grew from around fifty thousand to over one million. The cause of this spectacular forestation of Los Angeles during this time period can be attributed to the effort made by an organization known as TreePeople.  
   
Located in Coldwater Canyon Park, TreePeople is a nonprofit environmentalist group that strives to empower the public through tree planting. The organization was founded by Andy Lipkis in 1973 (TreePeople Lipkis). Ever since his teenage years, Lipkis had always cared for the nature around him. When he was fifteen, he realized the urbanization of Los Angeles was affecting the forests surrounding the city. It all started during a hiking trip in the forest. Because of the large amount of smog and pollution from the city, Lipkis predicted that the entire forest would be gone if the city did not take action. Thus, that summer, Lipkis began planting trees to rehabilitate the damaged area. The first project involved only about thirty volunteers. Together, they planted a small batch of smog tolerant seedlings in a dirt lot. Over the years, the organization united people from various backgrounds and grew exponentially.

According to TreePeople, trees have a myriad of irreplaceable environmental and health benefits. In highly polluted and urbanized cities such as Los Angeles, planting trees will not only help improve the air quality but also prevent flooding and replenish the already diminishing groundwater. TreePeople educates the general public about the importance of trees and encourages them to get involved in protecting nature around the city. TreePeople includes members from various backgrounds such as retired teachers and students of all ages. With the help of the Los Angeles Times, Lipkis was able to spread the word about his goal of adapting cities for sustainable living. Soon, donations began pouring in. By 1973, eighteen-year-old Lipkis had enough funding to officially create TreePeople.

One of the major accomplishments of TreePeople is the Urban Forest Project with the goal of planting an estimated one million trees throughout Los Angeles. They intended to create an “urban forest” in anticipation of the upcoming 1984 Olympic games. To achieve their goal, they sought help from the community. Because of 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students “high enthusiasm and comprehension level,” TreePeople mainly leveraged their efforts on them(UCLA). The project also provided appropriate education to their age group.  By providing the schools with the necessary soil, tools, and seedlings, TreePeople provided an opportunity for students to get hands-on experience. Countless schools throughout the city enrolled in the project.

From August 1981 to December 1983, the TreePeople had only planted about 50,000 trees, about 5% of their one million goal. By 1984, they only planted around 200,000 trees, approximately 20% of their goal. At the end of August 1984, TreePeople finally finished their project, but many questioned how they managed to plant 95% percent of their goal in one year (UCLA). The fact of the matter was that TreePeople didn't plant all one million trees. Residents counted trees in the area along with the trees they planted. The organization realized that the goal of planting one million new trees was impossible to accomplish in a few years. Thus, they changed their goal to “having one million trees in Los Angeles.” By the end of the campaign, TreePeople only succeeded in planting about 250,000 trees. Los Angeles did not look significantly different than it did three years before the project started. After all, over the three years, people continued to chisel away at the trees by tearing them down to build new buildings. While they did not reach their initial goal, TreePeople successfully encouraged the possibility of an urban forest and educated Angelenos about the importance of planting trees. 

TreePeople continues to make significant community-based conservation progress. In 2016, the organization partnered up with the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, the Los Angeles County Flood Control District, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to form the Greater LA Water Collaborative to resolve the water crisis in Southern California. This program, called the Collaborative’s StormCatcher Project, renovated houses by creating rain gardens and cisterns, allowing up to 1320 gallons of stormwater to be captured by each household. The project helped local water supply during drought, reduced the risk of flooding during El-Nino winters, and improved water quality. They intend to develop a climate-resilient Los Angeles. 

Recently, in November 2019, TreePeople acquired the Mountains Restoration Trust, a conservation organization that researches and monitors 3000 acres of wilderness in Santa Monica Mountains. Moving towards to become the largest community-driven environmental organization in Los Angeles, TreePeople develop larger-scale urban forestry, tree-planting, and water conservation programs in Southern California. TreePeople continues to expand and reach different communities to promote green, sustainable, and climate-ready Los Angeles.
