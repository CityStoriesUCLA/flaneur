During the 1920s, most of Southern California was racially divided into the urban and suburban areas of the region. At the time, blacks moved to areas of the city proximate to industrial labor. Conversely, southern whites flocked to segregated suburban neighborhoods to avoid the growing African American population. After the end of World War I, members of the Ku Klux Klan headed to the west with the intention of converting whites to the beliefs of the Klan. Most Klansmen believed the modern urban environment was essentially “wicked” and only the return to the past could save the future. This backwards way of looking at life was soon introduced as religious fundamentals in many churches and increased the influence of the KKK. Essentially, this led to the increase in racial segregation in Los Angeles. 

One factor that intensified racial discrimination was their “war on words,” which was the use of the media to announce hatred towards the opposing race (Journey of the West 55). The white population used the press to discriminate against the black race and defend white supremacy. Reverend Robert Shuler, the minister of the Trinity Methodist Church and the Knights of the KKK at the time, played a major part in discriminating against blacks. He attacked the black press and believed African Americans had the strong desire to become part of the white race. In his papers, he cited multiple advertisements in black newspapers for their cosmetics in erasing indications of blackness, such as the “Tan Away” skin bleach. At the same time, the growing population of the KKK made life difficult for many black Angelenos; however, it was the growing use of newspapers that informed the black community about social inequality and spurred black activism, which eventually led to the Civil Rights Movement. These public attacks made from both communities exacerbated the racial division between the two regions of Southern California. 

In response to the violence and discrimination faced by blacks, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) formed in the late 1940s, which marked the first roots of the Civil Rights Movement in the city of Los Angeles. Initially established as a civil rights wing for the California Communist Party, the Civil Rights Congress advocated for equal rights for the growing population of working-class African Americans in the city. Even though the CRC was motivated by a political agenda, it resulted in the spread of solidarity between minorities in order to rally for equal rights. The CRC worked with labor unions, local community groups, and government officials in order to ensure a better environment for the African American community. 

The influence of the KKK continued to spread throughout the 1960s. In September of 1966, Klansmen who resided in the region planned an event to instill fear into the black American community. Clifford Vaughs, the director of the Freedom City Civil Rights Movement, was one of the most influential leaders in bringing public attention to the event. In the photograph of his press release warning of the pending church-based rally, Vaughs advocated his support for the African American community and encouraged the use of the press to “expose the insanity of the racists” of the upcoming Soledad Canyon KKK gathering (Vaughs). His press conference led to the increased use of newspapers and the media to publicize the event and spread awareness about their racist philosophies. By informing the public about the racial intentions of the rally leaders, Vaughs challenged racial segregation and discrimination in Los Angeles in support of the Civil Rights Movement. 

The outcome of the press conference played a major role in the failure of the KKK rally in Soledad Canyon. Vaugh’s use of the media to spread awareness resulted in a decreased turnout compared to what was expected. They initially expected about 5,000-10,000 in attendance but only resulted in about 30-100 followers present. Conversely, there was an increase in protesters who attended the rally challenging the beliefs of the KKK. This event significantly decreased the influence of the KKK and increased awareness of the Civil Rights Movement in Southern California.
