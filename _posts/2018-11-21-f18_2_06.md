The image named "Fence Enclosure in a Warehouse Used for Detaining Illegal Aliens, Los Angeles, Calif., 1977," was taken by photographer Fitzgerald Whitney, for the the _Los Angeles Times_ article, "INS Locks Up Illegal Aliens in Dark Warehouse." Both Whitney and the author of the article, Narda Zacchino, portrayed the inadequate conditions of a detention center hidden in a warehouse - located in Bell City, Los Angeles. Whitney captured the dark scenery of these conditions to bring awareness to the injustice Mexican immigrants faced in this detention center.  

Zacchino captured these conditions to expose the health code violations under US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) authority. She begins this exposure by informing how immigrants were placed in the warehouse because other adequate immigration detention centers were filled to their maximum capacity. Several government employees described the immigrants' living condition as "deplorable" and "dismal" since the facility was structured like an animal cage. "The divided enclosure [resembled] a large cage, about 10 feet high with barbed wire atop the fence and wrapped around wooden pillars which [extended] to the roof of the huge warehouse," (Zacchino _Locks Up_, 1977). The center did not meet the "specifications of the General Services Administrations" nor the "health and safety code of the [Los Angeles County]" (Zacchino _Closed_, 1977). Representative Edward R. Royal, who visited the facility personally, claimed it was "dehumanizing and in complete disregard of human rights," (Zacchino _Closed_, 1977). Zacchino proves this by describing the inmates' lack of privacy and insufficient resources within the structure. She writes, "one side of the enclosure contained one portable chemical toilet and the other side of the structure contained two urinals and two toilets” (Zacchino _Locks Up_, 1977). In other words, there were only 5 toilets for a total of 200 inmates! The most shocking fact is that these toilets were kept unsheltered because the INS believed that immigrants were a harm to others and to themselves, which illustrates the condescending attitude INS authorities took towards Mexican immigrants. Fortunately, the Bell warehouse was ordered closed by the INS Commissioner Leonel J. Castillo, since he proclaimed that it was "fit to house only 'dog food'" (Zacchino _Closed_, 1977). 

The despicable movement that led to the creation of the cage originates from an uprising issue that occurred during the 1970s. In the 1970s, the United States began experiencing a transformation in the particular groups who immigrated into the country. Prior to the 1970s, immigrants were predominantly coming from Europe, but after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, other ethnic groups were given the opportunity to immigrate (Hispman, 2017). This led to the multitude of Latin American and Asian immigration into the United States. This time period is also known as the fourth wave of immigration in the U.S. In 1974, as immigration spiraled, the ideology of unauthorized immigration was introduced to the American culture. Although the 1965 Act led to a positive shift in demographic diversity, this change created backlash leading to stricter immigration regulations and the arrest of 788,154 immigrants by INS authorities (Martin, 2014). Later, regulations intensified during the late 1970s and early 1980s as immigration raids began to occur on a regular basis (Vives, 2017). INS officers ruthlessly raided and arrested Mexican and Central American communities creating constant fear of detainment among the immigrants. This fear followed immigrants through their daily lives whether is was at home, bus stops, clubs, stores, factories, and agricultural fields (Vives, 2017). When undocumented people were arrested, they were then placed in detention centers like the image in the _Los Angeles Times_. Detention centers, as stated by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), were placed for “... individuals suspected of illegal entry [and] unauthorized arrival…”(Wong, 2015). Authorities would assume that undocumented people who were working in factories, or waiting for a bus, were dangerous to society. The simplest and most innocent actions were believed to be destructive; therefore, authorities felt the need to implement these centers for “suspects.” This prejudice led to the incarceration of the innumerable number of “illegal alien” detainment.

The article conveys a valuable message about a demographic issue America has faced for several years. Zacchino includes the word “alien” when referring to innocent immigrants who came to this country searching for a better life. The cage in the image was utilized to condemn illegal immigrants for their “treacherous crime” of immigrating without permission; however, the real crime is our country's creation of a demeaning detention center that enhanced disapproval and discrimination towards immigrants. This photograph captured a cruel historical moment regarding U.S. immigration regulations. The U.S. claims to be “the land of the free,” yet ironically it has perpetuated detainment. There are cases, today, that demonstrate the ignorance of many who support such laws and regulations that undermine and punish undocumented individuals. For example, almost a year ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said,

>“‘uncooperative jurisdictions' such as Los Angeles... have forced ICE agents to 'conduct at-large arrests in the community, putting officers, the general public and the aliens at greater risk, and increasing the incidence of collateral arrests’” (Carcamo, 2018).

The passage includes the dehumanizing term “alien;” however, the demand to abolish this word when identifying immigrants has been addressed. In 2015, Gov Jerry Brown enforced that “[the] word “alien” will no longer appear in California’s labor code because it could be seen as disparaging to people not born in the United States” (Lee, 2015). Despite Gov. Jerry Brown’s pledge to discourage this pessimistic perspective on undocumented, this article proves that this view has not changed. After several decades, racial prejudice is still present in our country. 

The fence enclosure image represents the mistreatment that the Mexican immigrants endured during the twentieth-century. Immigrants were seen as inferior, and the cage-like structure depicts this condescending attitude that the INS held towards the immigrants. Law enforcement officials were aware of these dehumanizing circumstances but did not attempt to make a difference. A lot of this backlash against immigrants still exists in the modern world; therefore, our Los Angeles community needs to take action by encouraging solidarity with undocumented individuals.
