   On the night of March 3, 1991, news stations across the world aired video footage of three white police officers brutally beating a lone black man in Los Angeles. Outraged by the display of unnecessary force, Los Angeles’ African-American community mobilized and demanded that LAPD be held responsible for the abuse. While the video evidence seemingly incriminated the involved officers, the jury, comprised of twelve individuals — ten white, one Hispanic, and one Asian —  acquitted the four police officers on all accounts. Following the announcement of the verdict, violent protests erupted throughout Los Angeles, inflicting $1 billion in damage and 58 deaths (Callinicos). While the riots were attributed to the result of the trial, further analysis of the protests uncovered the deep history of injustice and racism in the city of Los Angeles. 

In the document, Interview with Gary Watson, Watson, a local black lawyer, discussed the disenfranchisement faced by African-Americans in Los Angeles during the mid-to-late twentieth century. During his interview, Watson connected the black community’s lack of educational and employment opportunities to the volatility of the Rodney King riots. While media outlets linked the protests to the outcome of the trial, Watson argued that the explosive riots had a much deeper cause. 

When questioned about the underlying causes of the riots, Watson asserted that the historical lack of economic and educational opportunities for minority communities provoked immense frustration in the community. At the start of World War II, African-American families began to move away from the South in search of new employment opportunities. For many predominantly white cities, such as Los Angeles, this migration significantly altered the demographic composition of local neighborhoods, sparking the emergence of racist policies and attitudes. Motivated by their unfounded fear of minority communities, Caucasian families flocked to the suburbs to escape their new neighbors, effectively removing the tax base from urban inner cities. In an attempt to reinforce the effects of white flight, financial institutions began engaging in the practice of redlining, denying African-American loan applications in white neighborhoods. With limited access to housing, black families settled in poor sections of the city — chiefly in South Central Los Angeles (Skolnick).

Because of the inadequate tax base, African-Americans faced declining public services and educational opportunities in South Central. As black men and women searched for jobs, employers throughout the city constructed racist policies to exclude them from their businesses. Management in Los Angeles’ booming movie and oil industries rejected black job seekers, forcing them to accept positions in low-wage occupations. This blunt discrimiation in the hiring process worked to further divide Los Angeles’ black and white communities (Brown). 

After half a century of disenfranchisement, resentment in African-American communities reached a breaking point. This frustration, combined with the devastating verdict of the Rodney King trial, motivated black residents to take action against the city. As asserted in his interview, Watson did not attribute the explosive riots in 1992 to the outcome of the Rodney King trial. Instead, he claimed  “the underlying frustration that many people felt by being disenfranchised in society” led African American activists and community members to engage in volatile protests (Jewelle). After decades of discrimination, the black community rallied to attract international attention to the systematic injustice occuring in Los Angeles. Through organizing and participating in five days of riots, African-Americans ensured that their call for change was heard loud and clear across the globe.
