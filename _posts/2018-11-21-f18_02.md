The poem, as pictured above, describes the popular local venue known as Al’s Bar. Although it came to an unfortunate close in 2001 due to the sale of American Hotel to Magnum Properties (Pike, 1), it still left its mark as an epicenter for underground arts and a spawning ground for many progressive bands. The owner of Al’s bar, downtown artist and entrepreneur Marc Kreisel, reportedly bought the business from the eponymous Al, who previously ran the place as a truck stop cafe. When opening Al's as a performance space in 1979, Kreisel was looking for "a money pump"—he regarded running Al’s as a way to finance his artistic endeavors. His intention was to invest the money gained from artist customers to buying artworks or supporting galleries; later, he did fulfill his vision by opening the adjacent American Gallery as well as Al's National Theatre Company and its own recording imprint (Pike, 2). With the dual identity of artist and businessman, Kreisel successfully practiced the notion of “business for art’s sake.” There were two elements central to the daily operation of Al’s: the nondiscrimination attitude towards customers, and universal respect for performing artists. Kreisel’s policy was to give performers 70% of the profit taken (Cuda, 2), which was the reason behind the nondiscrimination attitude—all the label executives and managers weren’t given the privilege to save the admission fee, as Keisel told them that it’s the bar’s responsibility to pay the bands. The lines in the displayed poem “sweet talk won’t win, you just pay and go in” and “Al’s bar rules are non, well only one, Tip or Die!” mirror this exact phenomenon. Evident in the line, “Bass beats the body, w/ a million musics, sound surrounding you, embracing you,” Al's was a local venue with avant-garde rock bands active on its booking list. It was not only a training ground for hundreds of bands such as Beck, Sonic Youth, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but also an iconic clubhouse for progressive musicians outside of the rock mainstream. “We were always looking for the unknown, unsigned, underground talent,” worded by Jack Marquette, the manager who helped Kreisel book acts at Al's in the early 80s (Pike, 2). Another element integral to the ambiance of Al’s, other than the respectful and progressive attitude towards arts, was the participation of customers in constructing the interior aesthetics of the bar. Patrons “plastered again and again graffiti art” to add color to the distinctive and grungy decor of Al’s—the customers were not only receivers of the values transmitted by Al’s, they were also creators. 

From the casual phrasing style and liberal mindset of the poem, we can make connections to counterculture. Counterculture is a trend that took substantial influence in the ‘60s and ‘70s, and its major channel of artistic expression was rock n roll, the dominant music genre in Al’s bar. At early phase, counterculture was primarily saturated with anti-authoritarian attitude and fervent political discussions(McBride, 42). It later underwent transition: the lessening of political focus and anti-authoritarian attitude and greater harmony with mainstream values. The rise of Al’s bar in the ‘70s epitomized this latter phase of counterculture, an ideology that embraced irrationality, and the refusal to practice art at a professional level (Kozhevnikov, 1). The influence of this ideology on Al’s bar and its customers is suggested by the unorthodox style and hedonic attitude of this poem, the prioritizing of heart-felt performance over sound system quality (Pike, 2), and the progressive nature of most performing bands.

In the ‘70s, American poetry saw a revival of interest in surrealism (Dennis, 281), which is a cultural movement that is best known for its visual artworks and writings. Surrealism was considered a revolutionary movement in which artists painted illogical scenes out of everyday objects, allowing the subconscious to express itself. It was eccentric in the way that it aimed to blend dreams and reality into one entity through unexpected ambiguity. This unique movement paralleled the continuously rising popularity of rock in the same decade. The main goal of ‘70s rock musicians was to create polarization between two themes developed from the ‘60s—they aimed to strip down the music scene of works themed with peace and love, and pursue mental liberation further. Their main approaches involved adding catchy guitar riffs, emotional lyrics, and a lot of distortion (Sheinbaum, 29). Most songs brought up taboo topics such as sex because the musicians wanted to break boundaries and express emotions that were closest to people’s hearts but weren’t given enough voice. An awakening began to take place in American youth culture as surrealism and rock collectively influenced society. Both of these movements were highly encouraged and supported at Al’s Bar, where artists were welcomed to express these new cultural and artistic trends on stage. One of these artists was the author herself, Mona Jean Cedar. As a poet, Cedar had performed her compositions in venues all over Southern California for the past two decades (Schaffer, 1). The weekly talent night hosted by Al’s bar thus inspired resonation in Mona, as it enabled poets and musicians to try out new material and express their creativity.

Al’s bar was a local business that successfully practiced the model of “business for art’s sake,” an iconic music venue that was inclusive of all artists and customers, an incubator of rock innovation and cultural movements, and a stage for creative expressions. For its significant role in the LA rock music scene and comprehensive cultural formation, and for the multiple dimensions it enveloped, it will be continuously remembered and celebrated.
