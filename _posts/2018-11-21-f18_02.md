Our artifact is a photograph of _The Negro in California History_, which was debuted on August 19, 1949. The mural was praised not only for its commissioning by Golden State Mutual Life Insurance, the first insurance company catering to the African American community, but also for its realistic narrative of African Americans’ struggle in California. Charles Alston, one of the muralists chosen by Paul Williams, the building’s architect, had been influenced by cultural artists such as Diego Rivera, and was able to bring forward a “fusing of modern art styles with non-Western influences to create a new and distinctive African-American idiom” for the mural (Meyers 1). Alston completed the leftmost panel detailing events of exploration and colonization whereas the other artist chosen for the panels’ creation was Hale Woodruff, who completed the left panel with imagery of settlement and development. Woodruff studied with Rivera and had a similar technique to Alston that allowed for a seamless merge between the two groups in the building. The detailed narrative in the mural starts in 1527 with African American Californian explorers as well as pioneers, and takes viewers through a visual timeline to 1791 where 26 out of the 44 people who founded the Pueblo of Los Angeles were of African American ancestry (Meyers 1). Overall, the crowded composition and movement in the mural creates an energy for viewers to recognize the persistent struggles African Americans have to face in society. This, in coordination with the bright colors used, allowed the artists to make an impactful mural to coincide with the fantastic strides the insurance company established in breaking the pre-existing issues of racial inequality. 

In the early 1920s, the majority of Los Angeles’ African-American communities were unable to obtain affordable life-insurance as white-owned businesses, at the time, considered them uninsurable (Folkart). Soon after Texas insurance-salesman and publisher William Nickerson Jr. arrived in Los Angeles, he wanted to remedy the bleak situation. Unable to afford a lawyer, Nickerson studied law with the goal of creating an insurance company to accommodate the needs of African Americans. In 1925, Nickerson, together with fellow insurance salesman Norman O. Houston and businessman George A. Beavers, Jr., set out to found the first California-based, African-American run insurance company dedicated to provide insurance for the previously disadvantaged black community (Folkart). The company had humble beginnings with a rented, one-room office on Central Avenue but it quickly prospered financially as it found a market within the black community. Within three years the company had branched out to Pasadena, San Diego, Fresno, and Bakersfield with a total of over 100 employers. The Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company would continue to expand as far as Texas and Illinois and amass over $4 billion in policies (Folkart). In 1949, Golden State Mutual opened its final headquarters at 1999 West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles, which was designed by renowned African-American architect Paul Revere Williams. As a major institution within the black community, Beavers and other representatives of Golden State Mutual were active in the civil rights movement and became community leaders (Perchuk, 175). The company chose to support African American artists and amassed a culturally important collection of over 200 artworks, including _The Negro in California History_, that was displayed in the corridors of the company's building (Perchuk, 175).

The physical and historical context of the mural contributed to its significance and importance to the Los Angeles African American community. The Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company building was built when the neighborhood was in the midst of an ethnic transition. The primarily Caucasian composition of the West Adams district was strictly maintained by racially restrictive covenants, universal laws that prohibited leasing or re-selling houses in white communities to people of color until the late 1940s (Rauzi 1)(Vestal 15). In 1948, the Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer deemed racial restrictions on housing unconstitutional, prompting an influx of African Americans to West Adams (Carter 1)(Gonda ii). The African American-owned Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company building was built in the district one year later. The company’s clients were mainly African Americans who had been forced to pay high premiums or had been denied life insurance outright from local companies owned by Caucasians; therefore, the placement of the building in a previously white-controlled neighborhood highlighted the successes of African Americans in breaking the practice of segregation in Los Angeles (Rauzi 1).
