desc: "Hours after an encounter with the police, Ron Settles was hanging in his jail cell, according to police testimony, though unsubstantiated with photographic evidence. As shown in the image, the group of protestors were gathered near the area where Settles passed. This serves as a sign of solidarity for the suspicious passing of Settles."
