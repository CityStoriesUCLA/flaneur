“A Costly Lesson!” exclaims the decrepit advertisement from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. In the year 1980, the average two-month residential electric bill increased by $10 from the previous year, about a $30 increase by today’s inflation rate. So, why had electric bills gone up so fast? According to the ad, it was “Because of the staggering increase in the cost of fuel oil.” This advertisement, characterized by the cartoon man in a cap and gown pointing to a chalkboard, served to educate the public on the price increase. Oil prices during this decade hit staggering highs, pulling the price of fossil fuel-generated electricity with it. The LADWP, which is responsible for generating a tremendous amount of power for the city of Los Angeles, encouraged awareness and implored residents to save electricity. “Get on the Energy Diet Today!” their slogan asserts. By encouraging citizens to use less power, the LADWP was able to drive down the cost of electricity and conserve nonrenewable resources. Today, the LADWP utilizes more renewable resources to power the city, which are less volatile and more economically friendly. 

Despite its significant role in the distribution of power, the LADWP’s origins are rooted in water. In the mid nineteenth century, the city of Los Angeles outgrew its water distribution system; ditches that provided water for agriculture were insufficient for domestic use. Unable to update its own water system, the city handed over the responsibility of water distribution to the Los Angeles City Water Company, but the company violated the terms by extracting more water than allowed, prompting the city to wrestle back control. In February of 1902, the city of Los Angeles bought the water distribution system for $2 million and significantly expanded it to accommodate the city’s rapid growth. In 1903, the water system supplied 75% more locations; in 1904, the increase was 25%.  To supplement the water supply of the Los Angeles River, the Los Angeles Aqueduct was built in 1913 and would later be used to generate hydroelectric power in 1917; until then, private companies powered the city (Kahrl, 1982).

In 1882, Charles L. Howland, representing the San Francisco based California Electric Light Company (now PG&E), entered into a contract with the Los Angeles city council to erect seven 150-foot-high masts each carrying three electric lamps, distribution poles, and lines to supply these masts with electricity, making Los Angeles the first city in the US to entirely abandon gas for street lighting. This was such a success that in the year 1884, Howland and others formed the Los Angeles Electric Company, which made streetlights and supplied arc lights for commercial establishments. By 1916, three private utilities provided power within the city limits - LA Gas & Electric (formerly known as Los Angeles Electric Company), Pacific Light & Power, and Southern California Edison (“Water and Power Associates,”n.d.). 

Municipal electric distribution began in the year 1916 when the Bureau of Power and Light installed its first power pole on the corner of Pasadena Avenue and Piedmont street. The Bureau opened the San Francisquito Power Plant No.1, its first major hydro-electric power plant which used water from the recently completed Los Angeles aqueduct. By 1936, LA received power from the Hoover dam, which was and still is one of the major sources of renewable power. In the same year, the electric system of the LA Gas & Electric company (the last privately owned system in LA) was bought by the municipal Bureau of Power and Light with the help of revenue bonds. Subsequently, the Bureau of Power and Light and the Bureau of Water Works and Supply merged to become the LADWP. The development of power distribution infrastructure continued with the introduction of underground lines form the 1950s onwards.  In spite of the increase in fuel oil prices due to the World Wars, which in turn made the low-cost hydroelectric power extremely viable, LA still heavily relied on fossil fuels for its electricity (“Water and Power Associates,” n.d.).

Consequently, the oil crisis in the late 1970s, whose effects rippled into the early 1980s, affected LA greatly. It was the result of two events: the Yom Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution of 1979 (Lyndon, 2016). The Iranian Revolution caused oil workers in the region to go on strike and actively protest against the Iranian government. This caused a significant shortage of oil, which was later estimated to be around 2.5 million barrels per day. European countries and the United States depended heavily on the Middle East for crude oil. As a result of the actions of the US during the Iranian War, Iran, along with other Middle Eastern countries, imposed an embargo on crude oil exported to the US. The cost of oil jumped by 350%, and since so many consumer products are based on petroleum, the price spike rippled throughout the economy (“Energy Crisis (the 1970s)”, 2010). At the time, LA heavily relied on steam generators for most of its electricity production (“Early Power Generation”, n.d.). Although hydroelectric powerplants existed along the LA Aqueduct, they alone did not meet the demand for power of Los Angeles. Because steam is largely produced by burning fossil fuel to heat up water, the oil crisis affected the price of electricity as well. As a result, Congress and President Carter called for the conservation of energy, urging Americans to cut back on the use of electricity and gasoline. During this period, mass advertisements were spread regarding reducing energy consumption, leading to the advertisement depicted. Policymakers were also looking for more options to generate electricity that relied less on fossil fuels and more on renewable resources.

Although conserving electricity is no longer the foremost priority in the twenty first century, the LADWP has committed itself to a range of energy conservation and green-energy campaigns in recent years to combat climate change. The most prominent ones are the 15% energy saving goal - to be achieved by 2020 (City of Los Angeles, 2014) - and the carbon neutrality target by 2050 (PV magazine USA, 2019). The LADWP has started to reach these objectives by the means of a few programs: the Appliance Recycling Program that gives out $50 rebates when old refrigerators get recycled, the Certified Pool Pump Replacement Program which offers $1,000 rebates to consumers who have single speed pool pumps (The Energy Providers of Southern California, n.d.), and the LED light bulb distribution campaign which provides free bulbs to 1.4 million residential households in LADWP’s service area (LADWP, 2019). LADWP has vowed to completely cut its dependence on coal by 2025 (LADWP, 2013), intending to substitute it with renewable sources that are expected to account for 55% of the total power supply in 2030 and 65% in 2036 (LADWP, 2017). LADWP’s clean energy investments are impressive as well – its Pine Tree Wind Farm is “the largest municipally-owned wind farm in the U.S.” (Environmental Intelligence, n.d.), while the Solar Incentive Program has a budget of $30 million per year (DSIRE, 2019). With such investments, the largest municipal utility in the United States has the potential of achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050, leading to a more sustainable future for the City of Los Angeles.
