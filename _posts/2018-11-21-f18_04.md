Depicted below is the 1997 LA Youth newspaper article entitled “Self-destructive self-expression almost took me over the edge,” the anonymous author discusses the social power of graffiti and its role in building community among Los Angeles youth. The art form was popularized in the 1960s to 1970s, when disenfranchised city youth deployed it as an expression of their contempt toward their realities, which were far from that of the rich suburban children’s that they saw on television (Hedegaard). Over the years, graffiti has been met with hatred and disgust by the residents of Los Angeles, often considered “ugly” and associated with gangs, crime, and other negative ghetto stereotypes; however, its artistic value can only be truly appreciated by those who understand it and have been involved in this artwork scene.

Throughout the article, the author comments on how growing up in Watts, a neighborhood located in South Los Angeles, taught him to face the grim realities of the world. The large disparity between the wealthy and the poor was evident in many forms around Los Angeles, from public services to natural resources. The youth were especially aware of this economic gap; “[the suburbian] children had _parks_ to play in… [while the kids in the ghettos] had trains to spray on.”

In an effort to rebel against economic inequality, the working-class youth turned to graffiti. Although outsiders viewed graffiti as “killing” the city, the author explains how it was, instead, a form of self-expression, allowing the artists to convey their disgust toward their assumed “inferiority.” Still, many failed to see that graffiti wasn’t the problem, but rather the gangs that contributed to the city’s increasing violence. Between the 1980s and 1990s, the number of gang-related homicides increased, adding up to a startling total of over 7,000 cases (Hutson). This data could be most directly tied to the rise in numbers of violent street gang members and the use of firearms, but Hutson also cites the “worsening socioeconomic conditions in the inner city” as a source of the surge in gang violence.

Modern-day graffiti is typically used in association with gangs. By the time of this article, graffiti was used among the younger generation as a means of competition. “Get up,” which is basically one’s signature, was a huge part of this competition. Whichever graffiti crew’s “get up” was better would win the competition and receive a payment of “props and 5 cans of Krylon” for each member in the group. 

Graffiti in Los Angeles has become not only an art form, but also a reflection of youth culture in urban environments. It is an escape for the children who have seen too much, yet don’t get to see enough. It is a voice for concern, and hope that one day the problems facing impoverished areas like Watts will improve.
