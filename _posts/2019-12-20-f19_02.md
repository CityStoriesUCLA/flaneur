Housing discrimination became the center of heated tension in Los Angeles in the 1960’s when the Civil Rights Movement led government officials to prevent discrimination against African Americans seeking housing. Publications throughout the decade attempted to persuade the public against racial discrimination. A pamphlet titled “Questions and Answers About…The Initiative Against Fair Housing” discussed the misguided intent behind an initiative to revoke the Rumford Fair Housing Act, a law designed to put an end to housing injustice. The pamphlet, distributed in LA, inspired individuals to think about the relationship between the American values of property rights and equality of opportunity. 

After World War II, the African American community faced severe discrimination in LA. African American potential homebuyers were legally turned away from sufficient housing because of the color of their skin, and around 10% of California's public officials were Ku Klux Klan members (Rothstein). Between 1940 and 1944, the city’s African American population skyrocketed from 75,000 to 134,000, which drove the need for more affordable housing in LA. Unfortunately, the city adopted an unofficial policy of structured discrimination and inequality that led to the creation of black districts that still exist today (Gibbons). 

During the Civil Rights movement, government officials acted to protect minorities seeking property in the United States. In 1959,  California Governor Brown implemented the Unruh Act, which excluded discrimination in business settings (Rumford). William Bryan Rumford extended this law with the California Fair Housing Bill of 1963, also known as the Rumford Fair Housing Act. This new bill would illegalize the rejection of buyers, renters, or sellers in assisted housing accommodations and private housing on the basis of their race (“Rumford Housing…”). 

Although the Rumford Act intended to protect housing rights, many Californians viewed it as a violation of their individual rights. In response to this sentiment, the California Real Estate Association (CREA) petitioned an initiative to erase the Rumford Fair Housing Law (Galbraith 237). The active clause within this initiative stated that the state government, or any other agency, would not be allowed in any involvement with personal affairs of selling, leasing, or renting, while also reserving for voters the sole right to make changes to legislation regarding property (Galbraith 237). If passed, the initiative would directly repeal the Rumford Fair Housing Act, erasing protection against discrimination in housing. 

This initiative caused a heated dispute that led many to publish their opinions and thoughts. The artifact, “Questions and Answers About…The Initiative Against Fair Housing,” detailed the background behind this initiative that would create a “state of paralysis” for government officials who tried to end housing discrimination. It addressed concerns about the Rumford Act restricting free business and potentially causing harassment to property owners; however, it was biased against the initiative and remained emblematic to resolving the housing crisis during the Civil Rights Movement in LA. The persuasive pamphlet ultimately stated that protecting individuals from discrimination holds more importance than an individual’s right to private property (“Questions and Answers about…”) . 

Despite the efforts from supporters of the Rumford Fair Housing Act, including the authors of the artifact, Proposition 14 passed on November 3, 1964 with a majority vote of 68% (Gibson 49). Not all supporters of Proposition 14 wanted to prolong racial discrimination; rather, the fear of financial implications and the setting of a precedent that allowed the government to intervene in private affairs drove many to vote “yes” on the proposition (Merritt 296). Those in support of the Rumford Fair Housing Act still admitted that the law encroached on constitutional property rights, even if it did not violate them (Merritt 297). The California Supreme Court had expressed its skepticism of the constitutionality of the clause in the Proposition that only allowed voters to alter legislation that dealt with property (Galbraith 237). In May 1966, Proposition 14, or Article 1 Section 26 of the California Constitution at the time, was declared unconstitutional, (Gibson 49). The unconstitutionality of Proposition 14 was further affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in the case Rietman v. Mulkey (Gibson 49). 

The precedent established by Rietman v. Mulkey holds that states permitting discrimination in the rent and sale of private property violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result, the ramifications of the Rumford Housing Act leave a lasting impact by ensuring equal housing opportunities for the diverse community of LA. The Rumford Housing Act and the discussed Pamphlet set the stage for lawmakers and citizens to repair the historical racial inequity in LA. The legacy left by the Rumford Fair Housing Act serves as a reminder for Los Angeles citizens to push towards racially inclusive policies and laws, while Proposition 14 demonstrates citizen’s democratic right to debate against government involvement in private affairs, highlighting a balance between American values of property rights and equality of opportunity.
