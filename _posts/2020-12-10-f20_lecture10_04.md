In the late 1880s, “The Castle,” a twenty-room Victorian mansion with a “magnificent stained-glass front door” was built in Bunker Hill (Miranda). Its affectionate nickname was supposedly coined by the Donegans, the first family to live there, and thus the name most associated with the house (Rice). In the years that followed, the Donegan family moved out, and the new owner, Colton Russell, transformed “The Castle” into a boarding house. Over the next few decades, the mansion would be home to all walks of life, as those in search of low-income housing moved into the neighborhood (Miranda).

After World War II, the Bunker Hill area gradually lost its previously stable residential status as a consequence of the influx of migrants entering and exiting the neighborhood. By virtue of these transient tenants, the larger houses turned into rooming houses, and many residential hotels appeared, resulting in a shift of inner-city neighborhoods (Knack 1). Bunker Hill’s subsequent housing crisis, hilly topography, and difficult access rendered the region “an impediment to future development of the central business district” (Knack 1). Despite these obstacles, developers entered the region over the years to keep up with the city’s urbanization plans.

In 1951, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles determined that the Bunker Hill Neighborhood needed restoration because of a large stretch of dormancy in the formerly thriving district (Sideris and Sansbury 396). In the 1920s and 1930s, most of the high-end residents of Bunker Hill left to reside in the more stylish communities of Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and West Adams (Sideris and Sansbury 396). The former Victorian homes now provided boarding for an array of tenants, many of whom tarnished the mansions (Sideris and Sansbury 396).

With the beginning of the Great Depression, construction ceased while the number of inhabitants in the neighborhood continued to multiply (Sideris and Sansbury 396). Between 1930 and 1940, the population of Bunker Hill increased by 19%, yet the 1940 census only classified 2.2% of the houses as “owner-occupied;” by the 1950s, the neighborhood hosted 11,000 primarily lower-income residents (Sideris and Sansbury 396, 399). A variety of city agencies insisted on change to the district (Sideris and Sansbury 400). The police department considered Bunker Hill as a “high crime area” while the health department deemed only 18% of the homes as “acceptable habitations” (Sideris and Sansbury 400).

Therefore, in March 1959, the city council adopted the Proposed Urban Renewal Plan, which included proposals for the Bunker Hill neighborhood; by 1960, the Community Redevelopment Agency began destroying the forsaken mansions and replacing them with “3750 dwelling units, 3000 hotel units, 12 million square feet of office and over one-half million square feet of retail space” (Sideris and Sansbury 400). In the same year, the agency approved its first project for the new Bunker Hill neighborhood: an eight-story building to serve as the offices for the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (Knack 162). As the city attempted to revive the district, officials also ushered in its growing modernism, which included the construction of skyscrapers like the 42-story Union Bank building that towers over “The Castle” in the image.

As Los Angeles continued to grow and redevelop in the late 1950s, only two nineteenth century buildings remained: “The Castle” on Bunker Hill, and another residence known as “The Salt Box” located nearby. The city wanted to clear the area for new construction and arranged for the two houses to be moved to the Highland Park Heritage Museum for historical preservation. For months following the move, the two Victorian houses awaitied restoration before moving to the museum. During that period, both buildings were burned to the ground by arsonists and much
of their rich history was lost (Michelson).

From its origins as an upscale home to its transformation into a boarding house, “The Castle” on Bunker Hill was a relic of history at the forefront of a burgeoning city. It gave way to an ashy crime scene that anticipated the history and trajectory of the city of Los Angeles as a whole. The Bunker Hill neighborhood which was home to “The Castle” is now modern day downtown Los Angeles. In the last decade, the downtown area has been rapidly growing and
attracting businesses, artists, and developers alike, thus reclaiming its legacy as the booming epicenter of the city that first brought “The Castle” to fruition.

In front of the house are many cars in a parking lot. There are telephone poles and wires criss-crossing the setting.](images/bunkerhill.png)
