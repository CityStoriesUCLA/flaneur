The West Adams neighborhood overflows with history and grand architecture. As exemplified by the image of the Ecung-Ibbetson House. From its elegant Richardson-Romanesque style to its storied past ranging from brothel owners to a USC chairman, the Ecung-Ibbetson House reveals the hidden history and beauty of the neighborhood. West Adams Boulevard, now the oldest historic street in Los Angeles, was developed between 1900 - 1920s. From Figueroa and West Boulevard to Pico Boulevard and Jefferson, contractors were opening lots in a new district called West Adams (“About West Adams”). Architects flocked to the neighborhood as there was opportunity to practice and showcase their Victorian styles. They designed grand and elegant homes for elite classes: doctors, lawyers, oil barons like Edward L. Doheny, and port developers like Randolph Huntington Minor. In the wake of the Civil War many wealthy citizens bought a stately mansion in West Adams in order to experience leisure and beauty not afforded to them in Downtown Los Angeles (Nolan). During the Great Depression homeowners all over the U.S. were forced to sell their homes. The depression deeply affected West Adams and the entire makeup and reputation of the neighborhood transformed.

In the 1940s West Adams provided a battleground for some major disputes in the Civil Rights movement in Los Angeles. African-American entertainers moved into the neighborhood and renamed the area “Sugar Hill” (Morie and Green). Many of the white residents opposed this integration and in 1948 racial restrictions on housing became unconstitutional, ushering more wealthy African Americans to settle in West Adams. Joe Adams, someone who can recall the history of this district, states, "it went from an all-white neighborhood to an all-black neighborhood. Now you have a diversity that is really healthy.” Soon enough, it became the go-to neighborhood for African Americans in the twentieth-century. Unfortunately, by the late 1950s and early 1960s the construction of the Santa Monica Freeway cut through parts of West Adams. Due to this disturbance many of the significant homes were lost to the freeway project and the area declined through the 1970s. But in the early 1980s many wealthy African-Americans wanted to preserve the lavish neighborhood so homeowners started investing in the old mansions, remodeling and restoring the historic homes.

Built for a real estate developer in 1899, the Ecung-Ibbetson House with its conglomeration of styles is an unusual example of grand home. The house, situated in the heart of the historic neighborhood of West Adams, stands out beyond its title as the oldest home on the boulevard (Dyas). The house was designed by John Hooker in the Richardson-Romanesque style, which is known for its use of Spanish and French eleventh century Romanesque elements such as massive stone walls, big interior spaces, and semicircular arches. The house upholds its reputation as unique by incorporating features of other architectural movements (“Richardson, Henry Hobson (1838-1886)”). Its varied and mismatched windows are covered in prairie muntins, a detail usually reserved for homes of Craftsman, Arts and Crafts or Prairie styles, also, many of its features, such as its intricate glass work, look Victorian. The house is broken into two sections, separated by a small turret with a domed roof, one Romanesque with clean lines and the other Victorian with a grand porch. The two-story exterior is finished with sandstone bricks, solid oak hand-carved Greek columns, and a hammered tin roof. Inside, the house is equally as elegant with redwood ceilings, oak floors, bronze fixtures, and four stone fireplaces (Lachnit). The Ecung-Ibbetson house is unequivocally unique. Doug Carlton, the director of the preservational program Keep Old Los Angeles was charged with restoring the structure. He succinctly and accurately summed up the building in an interview, saying “[the Ecung-Ibbetson House is] California crazy” (Lachnit).

The grand nature and themes of the house expand beyond its architecture. The front lawn is occupied by a massive fig tree that was perhaps the feature that enticed Keep Old Los Angeles to take on the challenge of restoring the house. The tree’s expansive roots act as a jungle gym for neighborhood children and draw an outsider’s interest to the house itself. The Moreton Bay Fig is so significant to the neighborhood of West Adams that is was deemed a cultural monument in its own right (Brightwell). In 1980, the property and the tree were purchased by Carlton who intended to use the house as the headquarters of the organization. Members of Keep Old Los Angeles restored the Ecung-Ibbetson mansion by salvaging original details and restoring areas of the house that were damaged by past owners. Carlton and his crew made a point of removing the ragged curtains in order to display the leaded windows which scattered rainbows throughout the interior of the house. These beautiful optical effects provided the house with its new nickname “The Gem”. By 1990 the house had transformed into a hip, new restaurant called the Salisbury Manor, which made use of the house’s majesty to invite diners to have a grand experience (Perry). But in January of 1994 a number of historical buildings in the West Adams district experienced considerable damage ranging from minor to severe from the Northridge earthquake.  The earthquake destroyed the sandstone on the façade on the Ecung-Ibbetson House; however, the house was quickly restored. The house now takes its rightful place as a West Adams cultural and architectural landmark.
