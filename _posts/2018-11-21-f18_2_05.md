The Los Angeles Riots began in 1992 upon the release of the verdict of the four police officers involved in the beating of Rodney King. One year before, King, a black motorist, was brutally and mercilessly beaten by police officers after being pulled over. The story quickly gained national attention as a nearby resident filmed the incident and distributed the footage to a local news station. Although caught on tape and clearly illegal, the assault of King failed to unnerve the Simi Valley jury that acquitted all four police officers, allowing them to evade repercussions. On the night that the verdict was announced―April 29th, 1992―Los Angeles rallied together to protest a justice system that favored corrupt law enforcement over mistreated victims. By looting stores, starting fires, and assaulting drivers, participants of the LA Riots expressed their scorn for the unjust verdict of the Rodney King trials (Mydans).  Looking back on the riots today, many Americans would find their intentions to be noble; however, that was not the case for media outlets during the time of the Los Angeles Riots. Often framed as disruptors of peace by the media, the protestors were referred to as “rioters,” suggesting contempt from news channels for their cooperation in the riots.  

The picture artifact depicts two police officers standing in front of a boarded up door of a convenience store. On the door, someone had used graffiti to spell out “sorry, we’re empty.” This shows that while being looted, many people had to just fend for themselves instead of relying on the police to protect them. The fact that the cops came after and took a photograph with guns in hand showed how they tried to defuse the situation by acting like they were protecting the people. This was not reality however, proving again how much of an influence the media had.

The article “Where the Fuck Were the Cops?” was written by Joe Domanick with the intent of blasting the Los Angeles Police Department for its absence during the most violent parts of the Los Angeles Riots. The article itself starts with a story told from the point of view of Reginald Denny, a white store owner in South Central. He was taken from his truck and beaten nearly to death by a group of African Americans for “being white.” Domanick talks about this news story going viral, and he ponders how the police could have let this happen. Assault and other crimes such as looting started to be a common occurrences in Los Angeles; this led many people to think where the fuck are the cops? Domanick believed the answer to why the Los Angeles Police Department were unprepared for this level of chaos was simple. He believed it was because of the “traditional arrogance of both [police chief Daryl] Gates and his department, a lack of preparation, and sheer incompetence” (Domanick). Gates’ excuse for the whole debacle was that the police department did not know the verdict of the Rodney King trial would come out, and thus did not prepare for the backlash.

The picture in the artifact was taken outside of a Circuit City electronics store which had been looted during the riots (Arnold). It was taken by professional photographer Ted Soqui, who was working for LA Weekly in the Spring of 1992 to document the chaos. Over the course of five days, he worked tirelessly; during the day he photographed, and at night he developed the pictures. Considering that all of the camera stores had been looted and closed, Soqui himself had to process and print the film in his garage; however, his garage was not completely sealed from light, so he had to do all of his printing in the night hours before dawn.

When he photographed, Soqui had to be extremely careful. There had been incidents where photographers were beaten and robbed among the violence in LA.  For this reason, Soqui used his older camera—a Nikon F—and sometimes covered it with a brown paper bag to remain hidden (Soqui). To further blend in, he discarded his professional gear. For five days, Soqui photographed the events of the city; he followed the pillars of black smoke to get as close to the conflict as possible without getting caught in the mayhem. He was thrown into a variety of situations where people pointed guns at him and attempted to rob him; he talked himself out of harm’s way every time (Soqui). Through his perseverance and commitment to the task, he was able to take dozens of historically famous photographs, including the one in this article.

The story of Rodney King and the Los Angeles riots received much media attention. In the hours following the policemen’s non-guilty verdict, television stations immediately reported outbreaks of the “riot,” describing “thugs” committing arson and other crimes. Media coverage was extensive, especially during the first two weeks following the incident. The media painted these “rioters” as barbaric criminals; white audiences viewing this media depiction rendered the riots exactly how they wanted to—chaotic. Yet, for African American viewers, the perspective was different. For them, this was a protest about systematic and racial injustice that has manifested in America and resulted in the struggle African Americans face, which the media has essentially erased. The fairness of the media coverage is debatable, as members of different races expressed varying reactions to news clips of the riots. A white male UCLA student stated that there were “other better ways of, more constructive ways of [protesting], rather than going out and burning things” (Sullivan). On the other hand, an African American UCLA student reported that this was “not a riot,” but a rebellion (Sullivan). We can see how racial injustice has developed with the assistance of media bias, as these two groups view the same event with their own perspective.
