The Korean Bell of Friendship is an 18-ton bronze bell located on a knoll in Angel’s Gate Park, or the “Korean-American Peace Park”, on the coast of San Pedro, Los Angeles (De Weldon). Originally, the bell was a gift from the people and government of the Republic of Korea to the United States, celebrating the bicentennial jubilee of U.S. independence. It was cast in Korea, then shipped to the U.S (Choi). The bell was dedicated on Oct 3, 1976, and was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1978 (San Pedro). It also aims to honor the veterans who fought bravely in the Korean War, in which South Korea was invaded by North Korea, then survived with the support of the U.S. Army. Overlooking the Pacific, the Korean Bell of Friendship is a symbol of not only friendship but also trust and blood bonds between two nations in their histories. 
The bell, along with the traditional Korean square pavilion that houses it, is incorporated as an instrument. The convex bowl underneath the bell, the windpipe at the top, and the composition of the alloy together contribute to its majestic sound. It has a wooden log clapper to ring from the outside, and when the bell is struck by the clapper, the sound wave reverberates back and forth in the building (Choi). 

The bell is also a reflection of traditional Korean architecture. With a height of 12 feet, a diameter of 7.5 feet, and a thickness of 8 ft, the Bell of Friendship is one of the largest bells in the world. It is made of copper, tin, gold, nickel, lead, and phosphorus. Inscribed on the bell are four depictions of the Goddess of Liberty with a torch and a Korean spirit holding one of four symbols: the Korean national flag, national flower, a symbol of victory, and a dove of peace (San Pedro). A message is written in Korean and English respectively and engraved on the opposite sides of the bell, bearing a blessing from the Korean people. Also, the bell does not stand alone; there must be a framework that surrounds it. The Republic of Korea sent thirty South Korean craftsmen to build the structure on site to accommodate the Bell; it took them ten months and $569,680 to set the bell on the Belfry of Friendship. The Korean Bell of Friendship resides under a miniature pagoda pavilion supported by twelve columns that represent the animals of the Korean zodiac, which are also depicted on their respective column base. Dancheong, a traditional Korean decorative style, is used for the coloring of the pavilion. As a result, every aspect of this delicate gift was meaningfully designed in intricate, traditional Korean-style architecture. 

The Korean Bell of Friendship was constructed modeling the Bell of King Seongdeok, also known as the Divine Bell, which was made in 771 A.D. and still exists today in Gyeongju, South Korea. The Divine Bell is a national treasure because of its renowned sound that can be heard 40 miles away. It was built as a reminder for people to understand _ilseungwoneum_, the sound of enlightenment, and used in a Buddhist temple to summon people together. Those who heard the bell was brought tranquility and peace. Because bells symbolize freedom, justice, and unity, the Republic of Korea chose it as the object of the gift in hopes that it will sound the continued prosperity of the friendship between the two nations. 

Thirty-seven years after its initial arrival in 1976, the bell fell into a state of ruin and disrepair as birds and graffiti took over and the designs of the pavilion chipped off. But the Korean Friendship Bell Preservation Committee managed to contact the South Korean government and the company that cast the bell to enlist their help in restoring the structure. South Korea gladly provided monetary support seeing how devoted Los Angeles was to maintaining a cultural symbol. The restoration was concluded during its rededication by the city at a public ceremony on January 10, 2014.

Today, the Korean Bell of Friendship is one of the most popular historical monuments in the Los Angeles tourism industry. Trip Advisor, the world’s largest travel site, lists the Korean Bell of Friendship as the #42 out of 553 things to do in Los Angeles. The Friendship Bell is struck five times a year on New Year’s Eve, Independence Day, Korean Liberation Day, Korean American Day, and Constitution Day. The ringing of the Friendship Bell is often well-attended by locals and tourists alike. In addition to standard tourist functions, there are weddings and other special ceremonies held at the bell. Visitors of the bell and surrounding park point out the relaxing and beautiful view. One can have a picnic on the lawn while enjoying the view of the ocean and relaxing with family. Nearby there is a children’s play area, basketball court, soccer field, and recreation center (Gasperov).

The bell’s modern influence lies beyond its appearance and peaceful park location. Several placards surrounding the monument tell the stories of South Korea’s relationship with the United States. It educates those on the everlasting friendship and the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States, the Korean War, and the story of how the bell was cast and gifted to the United States. Given the symbolic architecture of the bell and the large Korean population in Los Angeles, the bell has had a prominent place in the US and Los Angeles history, culture, and environment.
