   Regardless of where people are, violence will be inevitable at times and it will occur once in a while. However, certain regions have an especially high prevalence and frequency of violence, specifically police brutality towards minorities, in comparison to other nearby cities. When and why did this begin? What were the steps taken to improve this issue? If little improvement has shown, then what is the real problem behind all the events regarding police brutality? Because of  inexcusable police subjugation of minorities, and exploitation of authority, especially in LA County, we must look more closely at its history and specific cases to seek for solutions.

Since the founding of the first police department in Boston in 1838, officers have abused power. Fifteen years later, in 1853, Los Angeles established its first force, called the Rangers, who volunteered to assist the County Sheriff and Marshal (“The LAPD: 1850-1900”). “Police brutality” was used as a heading for the first time as early as on Oct 12, 1872, when the Chicago Tribune reported a prisoner shamefully maltreated by officers at the Harrison Street Police Station (“Police Brutality”). On June 13, 1899, the term appeared in the headlines of the Los Angeles Times (“Mercurial French”). However, numerous incidents of violence by police officers were reported much earlier than 1899, mainly during labor strikes and riots. To prevent further abuse of authoritative power, in 1961 the Supreme Court allowed a cause of action (The Urban Lawyer 228), which gave individuals the right to sue government employees, including police officers, for violations of civil rights. From the 1980s to now, Congress has passed significant legislation authorizing the Department of Justice to initiate investigations and pursue litigation against police entities (Barrineau 187). Nevertheless, in recent decades, the issue of police violence and the abusive use of power in Los Angeles County has not declined even under these reform legislations. Numerous examples exist, especially the well-known Rodney King case on March 3, 1991. 

There is evidence that Black and Mexican American neighborhoods suffer more arrests compared to the white neighborhoods nearby. While “the number of reported...incidents...in the predominantly African American 77th Division was 92.7 per 1,000 residents with an arrest rate of 29.9…, the white West Los Angeles Division, in contrast...was 39 but the arrest rate was 3.8 per 1,000 residents” (Felker-Kantor 22). Along with this, evidence has shown that numerous homicides in police shootings reported by the Internal Affairs Division were unjustified. For instance, in 1965, “the police committed sixty-four homicides of which sixty-two were ruled justifiable. [However,] in twenty-seven of the cases, the victim was shot in the back; twenty-five of the suspects were unarmed and four had committed no crime when shot” (Felker-Kantor 21). 

Not only did the police force commit unwarranted actions, but they also abused their authoritative powers continuously and relentlessly on ethnic and minority groups. In 1961, police officers arrested a black teenager due to the failure to pay for a merry-go-round. After people’s protests, “police swarmed the area with more than seventy-five reinforcements, and the “riot” ended with the arrest of three other black youth” (Felker-Kantor 25). Following the arrest, the police kept the black youth in custody with insufficient evidence of the harm they caused. The targeted minority group also included Muslims, whom the police investigated after they removed clothing from a car. Within minutes, the “LAPD flooded the area with seventy-five officers... [and]...the police [shot] seven unarmed Nation of Islam members” (Felker-Kantor 25).

The Rodney King incident exemplifies both the unjust treatments towards minority groups and the abuse of power by the police. The viral footage of police brutality portrayed four “white officers against an unarmed black man,” beating him with “fifty-two baton swings” (Rabinowitz 143). The public knew that the video proved the cops guilty, yet they were eventually acquitted. Because the police officers have the authority “to define and enforce the boundaries of order and model citizenship,” no imposed limits could stop their harmful actions (Felker-Kantor 22). Moreover, widespread racism and discrimination still exist among the white police officers. Parker, a chief police officer stated that “you cannot ignore the genes in the behavior pattern of people,” referencing that African Americans commit more crimes than all other races (Felker-Kantor 23). As a result of the over-usage of power along with widespread discrimination, police brutality remained and worsened over the years.

Rodney King’s beatdown provided a reason to reform and exposed an underlying issue within the country’s police system. Cassandra Chaney and Ray V. Robertson, authors of the journal Racism and Police Brutality in America, ultimately confirm Rodney King’s death as the culmination and acknowledgment of police brutality within LA’s community. They state "the videotaped beating of Rodney King was for many blacks in America the defining moment that provided undeniable proof that the police use excessive force (brutality) in their dealings with black citizens"(Chaney/Robertson 499). People, especially minorities, were very aware of the normalized misconducts performed by the police. Chaney and Robertson discovered that “police are 16 times more likely to murder" (Chaney/Robertson 490). Law enforcement's regularity of unjustified actions of abuse resulted from poor oversight and the lack of internal reform.

Court decisions regarding excessive police force tended in favor of the police. Chaney and Robertson highlight the leniency of the court system on police-related convictions by exclaiming “the average length of time convicted officers spent in prison was 14 months, [and] the average length of post-conviction incarceration for the general public was 49 months" (Chaney and Robertson 498). The sentence length of convicted officers was evidently shorter than the sentence of the general public. 

The majority of those who suffered unjust treatment and died at the mercy of the police were minorities. Societal acceptance of marginalization toward minorities downplayed the crimes done by police and magnified the exploitability of their power. Given the lack of proper training and oversight within individual police departments, police will uphold laws and use excessive force even if the law is unjust. This can be resolved through stricter disciplining of officers within the particular departments. Laws, unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how one wants to look at it), require time and painstaking efforts through activism and constant political support to be amended, but changes in legislation can be done. An immediate resolution could be a societal change of attitude and leniency towards police brutality. Crime should not be mitigated no matter who or what status the offender holds -- all crimes should be treated equally with justice.
