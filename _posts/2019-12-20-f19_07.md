On September 4, 1929, the United States stock market experienced the heaviest crash in history. The Great Depression was a worldwide economic catastrophe that ended up being one of the defining moments of the twentieth century. Its effects were felt throughout the country, and Malibu, California was no exception. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal dug the country out of the Depression through the creation of jobs and development of infrastructure. This became the foundation of Malibu as we know it today. 

Malibu is about a thirty mile drive from Downtown Los Angeles, yet many people living in the area today do not consider it part of the city. Somehow it is separate from the rest of Southern California. This idea can be traced back to the nineteenth century when Frederick and May Rindge owned all of Rancho Malibu and sealed it away from the public. When May’s husband died in 1905, she took full control of the family’s wealth. She kept her estate private as long as she could until the Great Depression crushed her fortune. She was forced to give it up to the Los Angeles County (Mauch 2015).
	
The Great Depression marked a transition period in the history of Malibu. Because the region was private until May Rindge was compelled to sell it, it remained largely undeveloped. The lack of residents in the area meant that it was teeming with untapped potential. Malibu was regarded as a kind of paradise. It was important that the country took advantage of its valuable land. Thus, Malibu underwent substantial development during the late 1920s and 30s, creating myriad jobs (Mauch 2015).

To maximize the land’s potential, Malibu needed the necessary infrastructure. Through various acts supported by Congress, Malibu began construction of new roads, bridges, schools, community parks, and drainage ditches. In 1926, May Rindge created a small ceramic tile factory. The Malibu Potteries employed more than one hundred workers to produce decorative tiles that furnished many public buildings and residences in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. Furthermore, Harold G. Ferguson, a real estate developer, negotiated with May to turn the mile-long stretch of beachfront near her ranch’s perimeter into a beach colony. He put up billboards throughout the state depicting families playing on empty beaches. This artwork created visages of privacy and tranquility; it attracted the public. Soon, the “Movie Colony” gained interest from movie stars and directors who eventually secured beachfront cottages. In this way, the land generated its own celebrity endorsements. This added to the “brand” of Malibu, and more residents moved there. The colony expanded via the establishment of its own police force, post office, courthouses, groceries, and general stores. This famous one-mile stretch of beach evolved into an independent town (Randall 2016). Yet, among these various developments was a precious gem: the construction of the Roosevelt Highway. 

Part of the New Deal, this highway exemplified the structures FDR imagined would be built. May Rindge did not like the prospect of her private land — her “kingdom” — coming under the control of the government, open for public use. Yet, in 1923, the Supreme Court declared that the county had the right to appropriate the land in order to build the new Roosevelt highway. The road was completed in 1929. Its opening was celebrated, with more than a thousand cars traversing its meanders after the then Californian Governor C.C. Young cut the ribbon. The Roosevelt Highway was renamed Pacific Coast Highway in 1941 (Masters 2016).

The appropriation of land to build the Roosevelt highway proved valuable for the entire country. The construction generated employment for unskilled workers. This prominent road eventually connected Mexican and Canadian borders. Thus, it assumed a pivotal position in trade between the US and these nations, which in turn created further employment opportunities for Americans in trade and transport industries. Another feat of the Roosevelt Highway was its impact on the quality of life of the people. It improved access to leisure and recreational activities through its linkage between different beach towns in the region. The highway sufficiently served Malibu’s transportation needs (Masters 2016). Both these factors, access to leisure, and improved transport systems, enhanced the overall quality of life in the LA county.  Hence, the Roosevelt Highway, or Pacific Coast Highway, as it came to be called, ameliorated the interconnectedness among people of the city, as well as among neighboring nations.
